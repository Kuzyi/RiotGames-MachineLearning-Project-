# Riot Games: League of Legends Machine Learning

Project to create a predictive model using machine learning for determining the results of the online videogame 'League of Legends' based on game data aquired 10 minutes in. Uses Python, SQL, and JavaScript. When a League of Legends username is entered into the field on the "Using the Machine" tab, the data of that user's most recently played game will be aquired through the Riot API and the model will make a prediction about the result based on the data 10 minutes in.
